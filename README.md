1. How would you rate your overall experience during the internship?
👍👍👍👍👍 (5/5 - Excellent)

2. What were your primary responsibilities and tasks?
As part of the Speedpay NetGen team, I worked primarily on the .NET stack where I contributed to developing, testing, and optimizing full-stack features. I was responsible for understanding business requirements, implementing backend logic, collaborating with the frontend team, attending stand-up meetings, and participating in Knowledge Transfer (KT) sessions to align with project objectives.

3. Did we meet your expectations from the internship?
✅ Yes, completely

4. If we didn't meet your expectations, how can we collaborate to support and align your expectations?
My expectations were fully met during the internship, and I’ve had a highly positive and enriching experience. I would, however, like to kindly share that while I’m currently working on the .NET stack, I’ve developed a strong interest in Java technologies. As I’m at the beginning of my career, I believe gaining exposure to Java-based projects would help me build a strong foundation moving forward.

If there’s any possibility to get involved in such projects, I’d truly appreciate the opportunity. That said, I remain fully committed to my current responsibilities and will continue contributing wherever needed. I’m sharing this to express my interest in case any relevant opportunities arise and would sincerely value your guidance.

5. What new skills or knowledge did you gain?
During the internship, I enhanced my understanding of full-stack development using the .NET stack, improved my debugging and problem-solving skills, and learned to work collaboratively in an Agile environment. I also gained insights into SDLC processes, unit testing, and version control using Git.

6. Were there opportunities for professional growth and development?
Yes, there were many valuable opportunities for professional growth through Knowledge Transfer sessions, hands-on project tasks, and consistent mentorship. These experiences significantly contributed to my learning and skill development.

While I’m currently working on the .NET stack and have learned a lot, I’ve developed a strong interest in Java technologies and would love to explore growth in that area as well. That said, I remain fully committed to my current responsibilities and am happy to continue contributing in my present role if a change isn’t feasible.

7. How would you describe the work culture and environment?
The work culture at ACI is inclusive, supportive, and growth-oriented. The environment encourages learning, collaboration, and innovation. Team members are approachable, and everyone values respect, teamwork, and accountability.

8. Did you feel welcomed and included by the team?
✅ Yes

9. Were the facilities and resources sufficient for your work?
✅ Yes

10. How would you rate the guidance and support from your supervisor?
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 (5/5 - Excellent)

11. Did you receive regular and constructive feedback?
✅ Yes

12. How could the supervision be improved?
The supervision was excellent. Timely feedback, regular check-ins, and clarity in task expectations were all well-maintained. No improvements needed at this time.

13. What did you enjoy the most about your internship?
I truly enjoyed being part of a collaborative team that trusted me with meaningful work. The Knowledge Transfer sessions, mentoring support, and opportunity to contribute to real-world tasks made the experience engaging and rewarding.

14. What challenges did you face, and how were they addressed?
At times, understanding legacy code and backend flows was challenging. However, the support from my mentor and the team helped me overcome these hurdles through patient guidance, code walkthroughs, and KT sessions.

15. What changes would you suggest to improve the internship program?
The program is very well-structured. If possible, offering interns a chance to explore additional tech stacks based on their interests (e.g., Java, cloud technologies) could further enhance their learning and alignment with long-term goals.

16. Are there any additional comments or feedback you would like to provide?
